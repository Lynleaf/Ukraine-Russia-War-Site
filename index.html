       Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia storms aggressively on to Ukraine due to past tensions during the The Russo-Ukrainian War, when they had the conflict of wanting to "demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine", in order to protect people that endured 8 years of intolerable treatment and genocide by Ukraine's government. However, Ukraine had a different perspective regarding that conflict, as they saw Russia as a destructive force that had performed an illegal annexation of Crimean Peninsula. Since then, they turned towards the West for support, one of the main reasons they wanted to join NATO.

  Ever since the 8 year conflict occurred, those tensions encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine, but this time with the intentions of power, money, and wanting the USSR back. Contrary to Russia, Ukraine wants to stay as an independent country and decline war. They wish to stay peaceful, as they believe the impact of the war would lead to more loss than benefit.

     <p>
  Currently, millions of Ukrainians have to flee to countries like Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, and Slovakia due to the war. Since many people’s properties are being destroyed and they have no peaceful place to live. This causes family separation, poverty, trauma, and numerous deaths or casualties. The war also impacts earth’s natural environment, where there is an increase in pollution when producing the materials needed for the weapons. It increases the Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, causing global warming. Lastly, due to this war, many Ukrainian women with their children are being locked up, raped and then brutally killed by Russian soldiers. Their children suffer extreme injuries, and are even brought to the point of death.

  Lee, a well known-Ukrainian actor, passed away after heavy Russian shelling in Irpin, at only 33 years of age. He was a famous actor who enjoyed a lavish lifestyle after his success in the Ukrainian versions of “The Lion King” and “The Hobbit”. However, Lee did not hesitate to step forth when his country was threatened, joining the Territorial Defence Force immediately after Russia’s invasion of the country. His bravery and contributions to the world and his country will not be forgotten.

      Shvets was a well deserving actor of recognition that had been passed away during the Ukraine invasion war, also referring to her death as “murder”. She left the world at 67 years of age due to a rocket attack on a building in Kyiv. Shvets’ work was recognized in many performances and theatre arts at Ternopil music and Kyiv Theatre of Satire, in addition to many feature films. Even after her death, her artistic gifts remain in our hearts.
